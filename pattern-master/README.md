ProudCity Pattern Library
=========================

#### This is the official ProudCity pattern library.

It is based on [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), and incorporates some elements from Bootstrap 4 like [cards](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/). It is available on [Bower](http://bower.io).

At [ProudCity](http://www.getproudcity.com) we use it to define common design patterns and mockup complete pages for getproudcity.com, our Drupal frontend [Proud theme](https://github.com/proudcity/proud/tree/master/themes/custom/proud_base), and our Drupal administration theme [Minimalist Admin](https://www.drupal.com/project/minimalist_admin).
