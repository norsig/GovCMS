# aGov Whitlam

### Digital Service Standard

The aGov base theme is built using the GOV.AU UI-Kit.
The UI-Kit is an accessible CSS Framework that has been developed by the DTA to comply with it's <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/">Digital Service Standard</a>.
The UI-Kit has it's own <a href="http://dto-design-guide.apps.staging.digital.gov.au/">style guide</a> in which it's components are fully documented.

### aGov and Drupal 8

In addition to the UI-Kit this theme is based on the agov_base theme which also provides basic CSS for common Drupal and aGov specific components which are documented in this style guide.
